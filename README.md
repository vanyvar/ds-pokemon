# PYTHON - POKEMON CHARACTER ANALYSIS
  Pokemon is a game created by Satoshi Tajiri and his colleague, Ken Sugimori in 1996, this game is quite popular with its unique characters.
  The dataset that I use is in .csv (Comma Separated Values) format which contains a collection of data regarding character statistics in the Pokemon Game,
  I also got some information from https://www.pokemon.com/us as basic material to better understand Pokemon characters.

  There are 2 characters in the Pokemon Game, legendary characters and ordinary characters, each character has a different number and type of elements,
  In general, the character who has the greatest statistics will always be the strongest, therefore this analysis will focus on character legendary.

  This analysis of legendary characters provides insight for users who are still unfamiliar with legendary characters, both in terms of statistics and character type.
  The characters taken in this analysis are from Generations 1 to 6.
  
  **Goals  :**
  1. Number of strongest Legendary Pokemon for each Generation.
  2. Five Legendary and Non-Legendary Characters with highest score.
  3. Determining a character's highest score as a legend or not.
  4. Determine Character that has 2 types always superior or not.
  5. Five best character in speed, attack, and defense.
  6. The type of character that most legendary characters have.
    
  **Insight  :**
  1. Legendary Character grouped by generation use barchart : dari 6 generasi, generasi 3 memiliki jumlah karakter legendari terbanyak.
  2. Legendary data sorted based on the highest total: There are 3 legendary characters and 4 non-legendary characters who have the same score.
  3. By scatterplot, use 400 samples data : The biggest score does not always determine that a character is legendary
  4. Based on score level and character type: having 2 types is not always superior
  5. Use barplot, sorted data by highest score for each statistic : Even though they are superior in terms of attack, there are still characters who have higher defense scores

  **Advice  :**
  1. Even though the title 'Legendary' is more attractive, when facing opponents, it is better to pay attention to the score, element type, and weakness analysis.
